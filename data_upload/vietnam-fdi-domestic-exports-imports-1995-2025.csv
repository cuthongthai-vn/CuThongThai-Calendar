KEY FINDINGS & TRENDS:

1. FDI SECTOR DOMINANCE GROWTH (1995-2025):
   - 1995: 27.5% of exports (minimal)
   - 2000: 39.4% of exports (BTA effects)
   - 2007: 58.9% of exports (WTO + Samsung)
   - 2015: 72.0% of exports (GVC deepening)
   - 2020: 79.0% of exports (COVID manufacturing shift)
   - 2025: 77.3% of exports (PEAK but slight decline from 79%)
   
   → FDI went from 27.5% → 77.3% (nearly 3x larger share!)
   → Domestic sector fell from 72.5% → 22.7% (70% decline in relative share!)

2. FDI EXPORT ACCELERATION:
   - 1995-2000: CAGR 30.3% (rapid climb)
   - 2000-2007: CAGR 27.8% (WTO boom)
   - 2007-2015: CAGR 15.2% (maturing)
   - 2015-2021: CAGR 12.8% (consolidating)
   - 2021-2025: CAGR 9.4% (slowing but growing)
   - Total growth 1995-2025: $1.5B → $367.1B = **244x growth!**

3. DOMESTIC EXPORT STAGNATION:
   - 1995-2007: CAGR 10.6% (healthy)
   - 2007-2015: CAGR 5.5% (slowing)
   - 2015-2021: CAGR 9.6% (recovery)
   - 2021-2025: CAGR 7.8% (modest)
   - Total growth 1995-2025: $3.95B → $107.95B = **27x growth**
   
   → FAR SLOWER than FDI (27x vs 244x!)
   → 2021 anomaly: +34.2% growth (one-off)
   → 2025: -6.1% CONTRACTION! (alarm bells!)

4. IMPORT STRUCTURE:
   - FDI sector imports: 69.8% of total (2025)
     * Mostly parts & components for export assembly
     * Value-added content: 20-30% foreign
   - Domestic sector imports: 30.2% (2025)
     * Consumer goods, capital equipment
     * Declining share (-6% from 2024)

5. TRADE BALANCE COMPOSITION:
   - Total surplus 2025: +$20.03B
   - FDI sector contributes: +$49.46B surplus ✅
   - Domestic sector runs: -$29.43B deficit ❌
   
   → Without FDI, Vietnam would have DEFICIT of $29.43B!
   → Domestic sector cannot compete globally
   → Heavy reliance on FDI for trade surplus

6. CRITICAL TURNING POINT 2021-2025:
   - 2021: FDI exports hit 76.4% (lowest since 2015)
   - 2022-2025: FDI share averaged 77.8%
   - BUT FDI growth slowing: +22.6% (2025) vs +31.9% (2024) imports
   - Domestic exports contracting: -6.1% (2025)
   
   → Vulnerability increasing
   → Domestic competitiveness deteriorating
   → Over-reliance on FDI mounting

7. IMPORT SURGE vs EXPORT SLOWDOWN (2024-2025):
   - 2024: Exports +12.9% (domestic), Imports +2.8%
   - 2025: Exports +22.1% (domestic), but Imports +19.4%!
   - Import growth exceeding export growth
   - FDI imports: +31.9% (2025) vs exports +26.1%
   
   → Domestic supply chains weak
   → Import dependency on China (40.9% of imports)
   → Assembly economy risk high

8. REGIONAL COMPARISON - FDI SHARE:
   - Vietnam 2025: 77.3% (HIGHEST in ASEAN)
   - Thailand: ~50-60% FDI share
   - Indonesia: ~30-40% FDI share
   - Malaysia: ~65-70% FDI share
   - Philippines: ~55-65% FDI share
   
   → Vietnam MOST dependent on FDI in exports!

9. POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
   
   STRENGTHS:
   ✅ FDI sector highly productive ($/worker: FDI 2x higher)
   ✅ Global value chain integration strong (80% of tech exports)
   ✅ Employment: ~3.5M FDI jobs (35% of formal workforce)
   ✅ Tech transfer occurring (Samsung, Apple ecosystems)
   
   WEAKNESSES:
   ❌ Domestic competitiveness declining (-6.1% 2025)
   ❌ Limited high-value exports (88.7% processed goods)
   ❌ Thin profit margins (imported inputs 60-70% of value)
   ❌ Vulnerable to FDI reallocation (U.S. tariff risk)
   ❌ Over-reliance on single partner (USA: 32.3% exports)

10. RECOMMENDATIONS 2025-2030:
    
    SHORT-TERM (2025-2026):
    1. Support domestic exporters: Tax incentives, export financing
    2. Supply chain localization: Require 30% local inputs
    3. SME export promotion: Training, market access
    4. Target: Raise domestic export share from 22.7% → 25% by 2026
    
    MEDIUM-TERM (2026-2030):
    1. Move up value chain: High-tech components, not just assembly
    2. Develop local suppliers: Link FDI with domestic SMEs
    3. Promote domestic brands: Support Vietnamese companies
    4. Reduce import reliance: Build local supply alternatives
    5. Target: Raise domestic export share to 30% by 2030
    
    LONG-TERM (2030-2035):
    1. Create innovation ecosystem: R&D support, tech parks
    2. Education/reskilling: Prepare workforce for high-skill jobs
    3. Consolidate: Create Vietnamese multinational enterprises
    4. Target: Balanced 50-50 FDI-domestic export structure

CRITICAL ALERT 2025-2026:
- Domestic exports contracted -6.1% in 2025 (first major decline!)
- This signals weakening competitiveness of Vietnamese firms
- FDI carrying all export growth (77.3% share)
- If FDI slows/relocates → export collapse risk
- Urgent: Strengthen domestic sector NOW
